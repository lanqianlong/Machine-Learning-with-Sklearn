prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment ross was subsequently found competent to waive his rights and was executed the prosecution filed a complaint against judge chatigny that was dismissed by the second circuit judicial council in a 24page decision on july 26 2006judge chatigny has been nominated by president barack obama to a seat on the second circuit court of appeals the nomination received a unanimous rating of well qualified from the american bar associations standing committee on the federal judiciary and the us judiciary committee approved the nomination on june 10 2010 on an 117 partyline vote no date was set for full senate considerationopposition to the nomination has centered upon judicial restraint and attitude toward sexual offenders on march 5 2010 one of the prosecutors in the ross case michael e ohara supervisory assistant states attorney for the state of connecticut wrote a 12page letter to the u s senate judiciary committee to elaborate upon the complaint that was filed and dismissed in 20052006 stating that judge chatignys actions certainly call into questions sic judge chatignys fitness to serve on the united states court of appeals for the second circuit a may 26 2010 washington times editorial enumerated 1 that chatigny served as cocounsel for director woody allen when he unsuccessfully complained against a prosecutor who had publicly

three republican former appointees as us attorney for the district of connecticut who said in a letter to the judiciary committee in april 2010 that they support without any reservation this nomination they wrote while each of us has dealt with judge chatigny under different circumstances we have found him to be even tempered thorough and without agenda we believe that he is a fair minded and impartial judge who has appropriate fitness and temperament for the appellate court we believe that a close examination of judge chatignys record in sentencing federal criminal defendants shows that he is appropriately sensitive to the facts of the person before him and the rights of victims of the crimes that have been committed indeed it is our understanding that the government has never filed an appeal from judge chatignys sentencings and that there has only been one defendant who has appealed from an upward departure we are of the strong opinion that judge chatignys record on the bench makes him an outstanding and very qualified candidate seventeen former federal prosecutors who have worked with judge chatigny wrote to the senate judiciary committee that in criminal as well as civil matters judge chatigny has proven himself over the course of 15 years on the bench to be unbiased compassionate and temperatein its 2006 dismissal of charges in the ross case the second circuit judicial council found that judge chatignys actions were not motivated by any bias in favor of ross the prisoner or against the death penalty but only by the judges reasonable perception that the discharge of his own judicial dutyrequired that he take forceful steps on rosss behalf while the judge used strong language there was no misconductin the judges reasonable view the circumstances thrust on him called for unusual action in discharge of judicial duty to ensure the fair resolution of the important proceeding before himchatigny has yet to rule on the appeal of former yale professor james van de velde who had sued the city of new haven in 2001 then yale in 2003 for allowing his name to be leaked at the inception of the investigation into the death of yale student suzanne jovin in december 1998 chatigny dismissed the federal fourth amendment claims in march 2004 but left alone the state claims relating to the ruination of van de veldes career by not allowing the case to proceed van de velde claims his efforts to shed light on the cold case and pressure the authorities try to solve the case have been stonewalledof the 440some opinions judge chatigny has

portuguesespeaking spokesperson of the yanomami indians in brazil he came to international prominence for this advocacy regarding tribal issues and amazon rainforest conservation when the tribal rights organization survival international invited him to accept the right livelihood award on its behalf in 1989 davi spoke to both the british and swedish parliaments about the catastrophic impact on yanomami health as a consequence of the illegal invasion of their land by 40000 garimpeiros or goldminers prince charles publicly called the situation genocide in a sevenyear period from 19871993 one fifth of the yanomami died from malaria and other diseases transmitted by the minersof all yanomami who have emerged as public figures probably the most important is davi kopenawa yanomami davi kopenawa was born near the rio toototobi near the border of venezuela he learned portuguese from a christian mission run by new tribes mission an american evangelical organization specializing in the proselytization of isolated peoples the acquisition of portuguese language proficiency then rare among the yanomami enabled davi kopenawa to interact with brazils lusophone majority both directly and through the mass mediain his own words translated from portuguesei know that the authorities and many people came here because the planet is sick and they are trying to find out how to cure it the people who come from many places from the other side of the big lake all come here to learn about how we live i want to speak giving the message from omai omai is the creator of the yanomami who also has created all the shaboris that are the shamans the shaboris are the ones that have the knowledge and they sent two of us to deliver their message the message is to stop destruction to stop taking out minerals from under the ground to stop taking out the steel with which all the metal utensils are made and to stop building roads we feel that a lot of riches have already been taken out of the indigenous lands and a lot of these riches are getting old and useless and it would be much better if the brazilian government would give these riches to the poor in brazil our work is to protect nature the wind the mountains the forest the animals and this is what we want to teach you peopledavi kopenawa is the soninlaw of another traditional tribal leader with whom he apprenticed to be a shaman his wife lost much of her family to measles and other diseases brought to the area in the 1970s by road construction crews and garimpeiros smalltime gold miners davi kopenawa has mentioned this as part of his personal motivation to speak out on his peoples behalf davi was orphaned as a child when his parents died from diseases transmitted by outsidersafter some months of staying on our territory they started to transmit malaria to us that means that the garimpeiros were already sick mosquitos bit the garimpeiros and then bit us that is how we got the disease the garimpeiros also brought in other diseases there are complications of pneumonia sometimes associated with malaria tuberculosis skin diseases that often are associated with other diseases and especially in children can be fatal there was an epidemic of yellow fever in the area hepatitis in the 1980s he began working for the brazilian government organization fundao nacional do ndio funai at a post in demini in the center of yanomami territory as an intermediary between the government and indigenous peoples with whom outsiders had little or no contact he also accompanied health workers to yanomami villages and has worked closely with organizations such as comisso pryanomami ccpy and survival international in the fight for the integrity of yanomami lands in brazilsince the invasion of yanomami territory began in 1987 by illegal goldminers davi kopenawa has worked for their removal from the area and for the creation of a parkland therein his action resulted in death threats from the miners and an award from the united nations environment programme in 1988 after a major international campaign led by davi survival international and ccpy the brazilian government finally recognized yanomami land rights in 1992 just before the uns earth summitdavi kopenawas unique role among his people has been commented on skeptically even by those sympathetic to him and his cause anthropologist napoleon chagnon wrote regarding davi kopenawa his nonyanomam supporters in brazil intelligent and wellintentioned advocates of the yanomam cause are promoting him as a spokesman for his people such a role exists largely because our culture must deal with other cultures through their leaders it is the only way we know how to deal with them everything i know about davi kobenaw is positive and i am confident that he is a sincere and honest man when i read his proclamations i am moved but i am also sure thatsomeone from our culture wrote them they have too much the voice of rousseaus idealism and sound very nonyanomam my concern is that he is being put into a difficult position fraught with consequences for the future of the yanomam for one thing there is currently no such thing as a panyanomam awareness and so he cannot possibly be speaking for the venezuelan yanomamsurvival international and many others with extensive experience of the yanomami have severely criticized chagnons work which portrays the yanomami as sly aggressive and intimidating and falsely claims that they live in a state of chronic warfare this characterization has undoubtedly been detrimental for them it was referred to by the brazilian government when it planned to fragment yanomami land in 1988 in a proposal which would have been catastrophic for the indians and which was only prevented by a vigorous campaignchagnons views in this matter were criticized by investigative journalist patrick tierney in his muchdefamed book darkness in el doradodavi has spoken out for over 20 years and visited many countries with his message about the importance of respecting indigenous peoples rights and their fundamental and unique role in conserving rainforest for the benefit of humanityin 2004 davi and other yanomami in brazil set up an organization called hutukara to defend their rights as well as advocating for yanomami rights it runs educational projects where yanomami teachers work in the communities teaching literacy maths geography and human rightsdavi continues to speak out about the dangers facing the yanomami he has warned about the impact large scale mining will have on the yanomami if the brazilian congress votes to allow mining on indigenous landswe the yanomami people think that mining will not bring any benefits to anyone it will only destroy nature it will only destroy the streams and the rivers and kill the fish and kill the environment and kill us and bring in diseases which never existed in our land it will bring roads and people who will bring in disease guns and violence so we the yanomami people do not want the national congress to approve the law or the president to sign it we do not want to accept this law our land has to be respected our land is our heritage a heritage which protects us this land belongs to us so that we can plant hunt be healthy it is our home where will live for the rest of our livesin 2009 he was honoured by the bartolome

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Donald_(jewellery_designer)>	John Donald (jewellery designer)	john donald is a british jeweller designer whose work is strongly identified in the 1960s and 1970s in london princess margaret and the queen mother purchased works by john donald in the 1960s having been introduced to him by antony armstrongjones 1st earl of snowdonexamples of donalds work are held in the collections of museum of scotland edinburgh victoria albert museum london and the collection of the worshipful company of goldsmithsan elegant revolutionaryin his halfcentury as a working jeweller john donald has been feted as an idealist a pioneering designer and as a craftsman part of a select group who revolutionised jewellery design in the early 1960s he went on to establish a successful business and an international reputation his work captures the late twentieth century ideals of glamour and modernityborn in 1928 to a golfing father and a socially ambitious mother john donald attended art college as a compromise between sport and university he studied graphic design at farnham and in 1952 he was offered the chance to enrol in the metalwork department of the royal college of art this change of direction was essentially a pragmatic one as the young man was keen to experience london but he soon discovered an affinity for working with metal that would shape the rest of his lifeat college john donald joined a group of hardworking and hardplaying exservicemen often staying in the studio late into the night he shared digs in chelsea with fellow metalwork students robert welch and gerald benney all three friends would later become famous for their silver and jewellery designshe graduated in 1955 and left a year later with a firstclass degree however it was several years before he could establish himself as a jeweller and in the meantime he was forced to support himself through a combination of male modelling and industrial design in 1960 the proceeds from designing luggage and national health spectacles at last allowed him to buy his own studio a year later he entered five pieces in the seminal international exhibition of modern jewellery 18901961 held at goldsmiths hall and by 1964 he could number princess margaret and the queen mother among his patronsjohn donalds designs perfectly caught the mood of freedom and excitement which swept britain during the 1960s using simple materials such as gold rod and uncut crystal he created expressive abstract pieces free from the conventions of shape and style which had constrained earlier jewels he was one of a small group of craftsmen whose radical entries to the international exhibition ushered in a new era of modern jewellery characterised by adventurous forms and textures the movement deliberately avoided showcasing precious materials or artificially imposing a subject it was as the sponsors of the exhibition proclaimed as uninhibited as modern sculpture or fashion individual imaginative and smartgeometric obsessions john donalds experimental techniquesjohn donalds jewellery is characterised by the dynamic energy created by its unusual forms and textures he started experimenting with gold and precious stones during the late 1950s and his difficult circumstances during that time forced him to take creative new directions in 1957 he bought a quantity of gold rods and chenier a smallbore tubing supplied directly by bullion merchants it was some of the only gold the struggling jeweller could afford but by cutting it into angled lengths or fusing tiny crosssections he was able to create dramatic geometric patterns the natural form of crystals was another source of inspiration less expensive and more diverse than conventional jewels their planes and striations were echoed in his textured surfaces one of his most distinctive motifs the cube directly developed from his use of squareshaped iron pyritesthe experimentation continued when he moved into his own studio in 1960 and it was here that he created another important motif the bead and cup pouring molten gold into cold water he discovered that it divided into small beads some of which caught bubbles of air and cooled into hollow cups the beads were painstakingly soldered together creating a complex surface of contrasting of convex and concave shapes he later cast bead and cup sections enabling him to use them in larger scale designsbeautiful intricate and thoroughly modern the jewels created with these techniques make a big impact using only simple componentscrowns shadows and the concern for textureone of john donalds signature techniques is the striking drum or crown mount framed by a protective basket of textured gold gems are set at the end of tiny rods to form glittering openwork constellations he has modestly said that the method was developed as a way round his lack of conventional skills however fixing the narrow rods into their tiny screwholes requires a high level of technical expertise the mounts are wholly unique and allow a delicacy of setting almost impossible with more traditional designsthe drums themselves reveal other john donald trademarks textured nugget flakes and wavy rods continuing his experiments with immersing molten metal in water the young jeweller discovered he could use this process to produce small flakes whose nuggetlike surface gave the gold an almost organic appearance these could be used in a variety of forms but they were especially effective when combined with the sinuous shapes of melted gold rod melting was also used to give other gold elements a fluid feel especially in the nuggetedged apertures which appear in some of his most spectacular jewelleryall these methods highlight john donalds deep preoccupation with the effects of texture of light like many of his contemporaries he rejected the monotony of traditional polished surfaces instead his work contrasts the glow of uneven metal with highly polished sheens and dazzling gemstones the shadows cast by his three dimensional forms adding an extra element of dramaa very fashionable craftsmanfrom the early 1960s john donalds reputation grew rapidly his work found favour with women of fashion as well as critics and he was able to produce jewellery whose avantgarde design was matched only by the beauty of their precious materials he married in 1962 and soon had two young children living above his bayswater workshopby the middle of the decade both john donalds business and his family were starting to outgrow his modest bayswater workshop and premises above it and he began searching for a new studio the site he eventually chose was 120 cheapside a small shop at the front of the new schroders bank building this was a significant choice by moving to a shop in the city he was opting not only to independently retail his work but to do so away from the traditional hub of the west end however he went ahead and in 1968 opened a small but elegant gallery and workshop delighting his landlords by bringing a working jeweller back to the elizabethan goldsmiths rowthe years that followed saw his business grow exponentially he opened one retail shop in bond street in 1971 and another in richmond in 1973 the former enterprise was a partnership with tecla pearls although lasting not much more than a year it allowed him to develop his imaginative and sensitive use of the gems the outlets enabled john donald to bring his innovative designs to a wide audience of more ordinary clients as well as his grand patrons from the banking and aristocratic worldseastern colour and oldfashioned influencesjohn donald travelled overseas right from the start of his career building up his international profile by exhibiting and selling new work in europe america and japan however his most important links were with the middle east and it was this region which inspired many of his designs in the closing decades of the centuryhe made his first visit there in 1969 holding a small exhibition at the sheraton hotel in kuwait it was an immediate success and he returned in 1971 when his threeweek stay earned enough money to see him through the crippling economic downturn which marked the beginning of that year the intense sunlight of the middle east drove him to be much bolder with his use of colours the islamic tiles and decorations he encountered on these trips were another source of new ideasanother great if unlikely influence on john donalds work originates much closer to home the quintessentially modern designer has studied victorian jewellery admiring its intricate thoughtful and honestly decorative style as a young student at the royal college of art he spent time looking at the victoria and albert museums extensive collection of 19th century jewels their elegant natural shapes and attention to detail find echoes in many of his pieces especially those which employ ingenious movable or interchangeable partsjohn donald and broochesbrooches were the first pieces of jewellery made by john donald using his innovative new techniques and they launched his career as an artistjeweller several examples representing his work at the 1961 international exhibition of modern jewellery the straight forward way in which brooches are worn gives maximum scope for experimentation and as a result he has always had a special fondness for this versatile ornamentsuch creative freedom means that some of his most important ideas can be traced through brooch design growth forms including minute organisms and minerals have been a theme informing his work from the very beginning the young john donald was one of the first jewellers to use uncut crystals studying specimens in the natural history museum the dramatic baroque expression of many examples reveals a wholly different influence a travelling scholarship he took to italy in 1955 here he absorbed the energy and drama of the countrys treasuresbut no matter how diverse his brooches like all his work are united by two overarching concerns the first is for the balance and integrity of his designsaccording to john donald all stones however valuable however beautiful must be subordinate to design the second is for their relationship with the wearer he has always maintained that i am very aware that my pieces are to be worn and when working on commissioned objects always take into account not only the appearance but the personality of the wearerout of the city and into the futurefor 37 years the cheapside shop occupied a unique place in the city of london the modern financial centre has its roots in the many goldsmiths workshops which populated the area in past centuries and as the only working goldsmith within the citys boundaries john donald provided an important link with these historic originsthis significant position was cemented by his very traditional role in creating pieces for the citys livery companies john donald has designed official regalia since the outset of his career producing his very first badge in 1956 whilst still a student at the royal college of art his first significant commission as an independent jeweller was to make three wardens badges for the goldsmiths company he was awarded the project in 1960 after winning a limited competition whose brief was to combine contemporary design with the companys ancient heraldic motifssince then he has made over 120 official badges all of which echo the skillful integration of old and new seen on this early example years of experience have also made him aware of not only the aesthetic but also the practical requirements of such pieces many are taken for repair after spending an eventful night tucked in the back pocket of a returning official so his designs are robust as well as attractivethe city lost its last goldsmith in 2005 when redevelopment led to the closure of the 120 cheapside shop however john donalds contribution to the world of precious metals is certainly far from over he is still driven with a passion for making beautiful objects and has planned a very active semiretirement working on specially commissioned pieces it is this desire for the handson experience of creation which has made his work so distinctive a consummate craftsman he has always been dedicated to producing things by hand believing in the importance of experimenting as a piece is madejohn donald claims that there have been no eureka moments in his career that his designs have instead evolved slowly over time this gradual distillation of ideas has enabled him to continue to innovate so that even now when his early work is being sold as prestigious antiques his jewellery displays an undeniable feeling of modernity

the national college of art and design dublin in 1977 she moved to japan where she lived and exhibited between 1979 and 1981 fitzgerald has held numerous solo exhibitions in ireland europe and the united states and has participated in group exhibitions worldwide she has represented ireland at rosc limaginaire irlandais and the xviii bienal de sao paulo her 2009 show afterlife which was held at the fenton gallery cork was reviewed in the irish times by aidan dunne on 27 may 2009 the exhibit was accompanied by the publication of a limited edition large format book by the same name published by four courts press it presented five of her recent works along with an essay by caoimhn mac giolla lith mac giolla lith is an art critic and lecturer and served on the 2005 turner prize jury along with nicholas serota director of the tate it was her first show since 1995 and was a return to a career interrupted by a car accident in the mid1980s that forced a creative hiatus she works out her studio in dublin as well as her home in waterford and has also resumed her travels recently spending time in africa the antarctic south america and asia she was in sri lanka when the tsunami hit in 2004 the sense of violence catastrophe and mortality is often reflected in her workfitzgeralds recent work has been characterised as an attempt to convey vulnerability through images which are impermanent transient and almost invisible she often utilises smoke grease and water condensation encased in plexiglass throughout the 1980s and early 1990s her work was largely spare and austere and she appeared to prefer a limited palette she often worked with a variety of media including glass metal fabric and paper and has designed a number of tapestries and carpets as well as costume designs for opera an understated approach is a continuing theme in her work the years she spent in japan clearly influenced her work and it sometimes featured quasicalligraphic marks characteristic of asian art she also works with materials that have a certain fragility and has been quoted as saying that as all experience is qualified by the inevitability of the end most art and hers in particular has a fundamental concern with death in conversation with felicity woolf fitzgeralds subjects could be described as grim focusing as they do on pain loss vulnerability to disaster the transience and fragility of life but her work does not depress there is an elegant austerity and a calm stillness to it work can be a way of coming to terms with difficult things and making something meaningful from what might otherwise overwhelm and destroy a 2009 video installation caoineadh 1 lament in irish has a rueful humour to it a pleading to get through the doorfrom 26 january 2012 3 march 2012 the first exhibition by mary fitzgerald at the green on red gallery in dublin takes place and is her first in dublin for some years the exhibition consists of an array of projected looped and even live images and objects installed in the gallery drawing and insinuating the viewer into the realm of its layered and sitespecific arrangement halflife is a dramatic shift in the artists practice and by any standard one of the most ambitious in its aims and realisation this seems wholly appropriate however for an artist of fitzgeralds ability and radicalism one can recognise themes and subtleties here that are wholly consistent with the younger fitzgerald for example even of her earlier works in oil on canvas fitzgerald was acutely aware of how the viewer and the object viewed cohabited the work has a physical relationship with the audience who share the same space it begins the process of communication the absence here of oil organisms metal pins etc on painted canvas or panel will surprise many halflife is nothing if not a new stage on this artists journey and an intriguing invitation to follow suitmortality is a central theme that continues in this exhibition to confront the artist and the viewer in fact through a series of narrative progressions the visitor is innocently plunged into a purgatorial route through the gallerys dimly lit spaces while watching and unwittingly being watched many emotions and themes are explored a sense of disorientation and confusion follows you as you plot through the work through the various media and the many different surface treatments and aspects there is no consistent or even visible horizon time and space are poorly defined in the dim light just as you are looking peering there is the slowly dawning realisation of being caught on camera in a crucial hallofmirrors moment the viewer himherself becomes subject and agent at once you are both actor and acted onthe blank minimal action of the enveloping four screen projection in passage echoes the achingly slow movement in bruce naumans mapping the studio i fat chance john cage 2001 but couldnt be further away in terms of artists studio the walls of fitzgeralds studio are nonexistent instead of containment there is openness to seeming infinityfitzgerald tackles issues of life and death head on we stand on the edge of nothingness and extinction in the extreme antarctic environment filmed on site in drakes passage argentina skeletal remains replace mirror images the exhibition opens and closes with mounds of dust fitzgerald is by no means the first artist to focus on the complete or closing life cycle as a central subject in her work eva hesse bas jan ader damien hirst have all made this universal subject a central inspiration or obsession few have contemplated such serious and pained subjects to such ethereal and entrancing effect through the telling use of sand water seeds dust bones and books the invitation to contemplation gives this journey a real purpose and conclusion notwithstanding regular sharp reminders of the harshest of conditions kant describes the sight of the night sky the expanse of which exceeds the field of vision and eludes the grasp of the imagination it is in the very instant however when the subject painfully experiences the limitations of the capacities of its own senses and finds itself overwhelmed by the vastness of the universe that the subject recognises that it bears the element of universality in itself in the form of the moral principle and can thus justifiably assert itself against the magnificence of nature the sublime becomes the pathway to an intensified sense of selfexperience bas jan ader in search of the miraculous jan verwoert p 51 lightduress by caoimhn macgiolla lith in mary fitzgerald
